/**
 * This interface provides a bridge between an aggregator and the optimization context, allowing
 * the aggregator to provide data and optimize the aggregation process.
 *
 * <p>The main purpose of this interface is to encapsulate the aggregator-specific optimization
 * logic and provide access to the data in Aggregator that is required for optimization, while keeping the optimization
 * business logic separate from the aggregator implementation.
 *
 * <p>To use this interface to optimize an aggregator, you should subclass this interface in this package
 * and put any specific optimization business logic in it. Then implement this subclass in the aggregator
 * to provide data that is needed for doing the optimization
